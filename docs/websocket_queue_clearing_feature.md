# WebSocket Queue Clearing Feature

## âœ… Feature Added Successfully!

Enhanced the WebSocketListener to automatically clear queued signals and packets when bullet spawning is disabled.

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works:**

### **Previous Behavior:**
- When `bullet_spawning_enabled = false`, the WebSocket listener would:
  - Stop emitting `bullet_hit` signals
  - BUT continue accumulating WebSocket packets in the internal queue
  - When re-enabled, all queued signals would flood the system

### **New Behavior:**
- When `set_bullet_spawning_enabled(false)` is called:
  - Stops emitting `bullet_hit` signals
  - **Automatically clears all queued WebSocket packets**
  - **Clears any pending bullet hit signals**
  - Resets rate limiting timer to prevent immediate flood when re-enabled

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

### **New Methods Added to WebSocketListener.gd:**

```gdscript
func clear_queued_signals():
    """Clear all queued WebSocket packets and pending bullet hit signals"""
    # Clear all pending WebSocket packets
    while socket.get_available_packet_count() > 0:
        socket.get_packet()  # Consume and discard
    
    # Clear pending bullet hit signals
    pending_bullet_hits.clear()
    
    # Reset rate limiting timer
    last_message_time = Time.get_ticks_msec() / 1000.0

func set_bullet_spawning_enabled(enabled: bool):
    """Set bullet spawning enabled state and clear queues when disabled"""
    bullet_spawning_enabled = enabled
    
    # Clear queues when disabling bullet spawning
    if not enabled:
        clear_queued_signals()
```

### **Updated drills.gd Integration:**

All calls to `ws_listener.bullet_spawning_enabled = false` have been replaced with:
```gdscript
ws_listener.set_bullet_spawning_enabled(false)
```

This ensures automatic queue clearing whenever bullet spawning is disabled.

## ðŸ“Š **Debug Output:**

When queues are cleared, you'll see console messages like:
```
[WebSocket] Bullet spawning enabled changed from true to false
[WebSocket] Clearing queued signals and packets
[WebSocket] Cleared 5 queued WebSocket packets
[WebSocket] Cleared 3 pending bullet hit signals
```

## ðŸŽ® **Usage Locations:**

The feature automatically activates in these scenarios:

1. **Shot Timer Phase** - When showing shot timer overlay
2. **Target Transitions** - When switching between targets in drills
3. **Drill Completion** - When temporarily disabling bullets for completion overlay
4. **Any manual disable** - When programmatically disabling bullet spawning

## ðŸš€ **Benefits:**

### **Performance:**
- Prevents accumulation of stale WebSocket packets
- Eliminates signal flooding when re-enabling bullet spawning
- Reduces memory usage during inactive periods

### **Responsiveness:**
- Clean slate when re-enabling bullet spawning
- No delayed reactions from old queued signals
- Immediate responsiveness to new input

### **Reliability:**
- Prevents timing issues from old signals
- Ensures consistent behavior across drill phases
- Better synchronization between WebSocket and game state

## ðŸ”— **Files Modified:**

- `/script/WebSocketListener.gd` - Added queue clearing functionality
- `/script/drills.gd` - Updated to use new setter method

The feature is backward compatible and requires no changes to existing target scripts or other components.
