Looking at the current bullet hit flow, I can identify several optimization opportunities for low-end hardware to make bullet holes appear faster when WebSocket signals arrive. Here's my analysis:
Current WebSocket Flow Issues
Current sequence:

WebSocket receives hit signal → transforms coordinates
Spawns full bullet scene (Area2D + effects + collision detection)
Bullet triggers collision → spawns bullet hole
Bullet spawns impact effects (smoke, particles)
Bullet cleanup after timer

Optimization Strategies
1. Direct Bullet Hole Spawning (Fastest)
Skip the bullet scene entirely for WebSocket hits:

WebSocket listener directly calls target.spawn_bullet_hole()
No bullet instantiation, collision detection, or effect spawning
Reduces overhead by ~80%

2. Lightweight Bullet Mode
Create a minimal bullet variant for WebSocket hits:

Remove Area2D collision (just use direct position)
Skip smoke/particle effects
Instant hole placement without impact animations

3. Pre-instantiated Bullet Pool

Keep 5-10 bullet holes pre-created in memory
Just reposition and show when needed
Eliminates instantiation overhead during gameplay

4. WebSocket Coordinate Optimization
Current coordinate transformation happens in each target:

Move transformation to WebSocketListener (do once vs per target)
Cache transformed coordinates
Use direct world→local conversion

5. Target Hit Detection Bypass
For WebSocket hits where you know the exact position:

Skip polygon/circle collision checks
Directly determine hit zone from coordinates
Pre-calculate zone boundaries

Recommended Implementation Order

Immediate fix: Direct bullet hole spawning in WebSocket handler
Medium term: Lightweight bullet mode with minimal effects
Performance: Object pooling for bullet holes

Code Locations to Modify

script/WebSocketListener.gd - Add direct hole spawning
script/paddle.gd (line 394) - _on_websocket_bullet_hit()
Similar methods in other target scripts
Possibly create BulletHoleFast.gd scene variant

Would you like me to implement the direct bullet hole spawning approach first? This would give you the biggest performance boost with minimal code changes.
